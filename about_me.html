						<p>Hi! I’m Mia, welcome to my language space. In this section I want to give you a little background on who I am and why language teaching is so important to me.
						<br>
						<br>I am a 21-year-old Spanish and Italian student, in my final year studying at Durham university. I have experience tutoring over 250 Spanish lessons online via My Tutor alongside a range of other in-person experience, including a 3-week long Spanish teaching internship. I have always been naturally inclined to teach and it is a career that I will peruse post-university.
						<br>
						<br>When I was 16 years old I moved to Galicia, in the north of Spain, where I lived and worked with a Spanish family over the summer. This was really what sparked my love of Spanish and what has ultimately led me to pursue a career with languages. Following on from this experience, I have also worked in a language school, teaching Spanish for 3 months this summer in Alicante. Overall, my experiences of cultural enrichment and social contact with native speakers abroad have given me a strong level of  Spanish and a desire to spread this passion through my own teaching.
						<br>
						<br>I decided to make my own language learning space because I strongly believe in the benefits of learning a second language and the skills and knowledge that comes with it, something that really can be appreciated by everyone.

								<h3>Learning languages for an exam!</h3>
								<p>I know that languages can be a real weakness for students, particularly in the UK, and I also realise how difficult it is to learn a new language from scratch. However, I hope that the experiences I have had teaching and the knowledge I have learnt can really help any students out there to learn Spanish to the best of their ability and showcase that in an exam. I make specialised plans for my students and work closely and flexibly with their needs, operating with a one size does NOT fit all mindset. In the free meeting we can begin to establish this and discuss better how I can support them on their GCSE or A-level journey and hopefully ignite some joy and passion for language learning.</p>

							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Learning languages for fun!</h3>
								<p>I am a big supporter of anyone who wants to learn a new language and will always have so much respect for those who take that leap later on in their life. Whether it be an introductory session for a holiday or to start a new retirement hobby - I have really seen it all before in my tutoring and am more than happy to help anyone. No matter how specialised your situation is, don’t hesitate to contact me and I will do my best to put together a personalised language learning plan that suits you and your needs.</p>
